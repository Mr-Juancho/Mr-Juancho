## 👋 Hey, I'm Juan
AI Engineer in the making | CS Student (Year 3) | Building real things with LLMs


Currently focused on LLM integration, voice AI, and NLP-driven data intelligence, 
with hands-on experience across the full AI stack: from prompt engineering and model orchestration to speech recognition and data mining.

🚀 Projects I'm proud of
🤖 JARVIS — Voice-enabled AI Assistant
A fully functional AI assistant with real-time speech recognition (Whisper), natural language understanding (LLMs via OpenAI API + local models with Ollama), 
and voice synthesis (ElevenLabs). Think Iron Man, but actually built by one person.

🔍 ARGOS (in progress) — Financial Loss Detection System
An NLP + data mining system designed to detect patterns of financial loss through intelligent data 
preprocessing and anomaly detection algorithms. Built for accuracy where it matters most.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python LangChain Hugging Face PyTorch OpenAI API Anthropic API Whisper ElevenLabs Ollama

📌 What I'm looking for
I'm actively seeking my first role as a Junior AI Engineer where I can contribute to meaningful AI products, keep growing fast, and work alongside people who take the craft seriously.
I learn by building. Check my repos — the code speaks for itself.
